    <p>Answer Questions</p>
    <p>1. How do you get help?</p>
    <p>-- Check the assignments and watch the attached videos. You can also get help from the tutors</p>
    <p>2. What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</p>
    <p>-- Engagements are due at the end of the first and second days of class. 4 engagements can be dropped if you have missed them. They cannot be turned in late.</p>
    <p>3. What time are projects due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</p>
    <p>-- Projects are due 5 am the day after they are due at the latest. They can be late/resubmitted up to 4 times through the semester.</p>
    <p>4. Describe the tags we discussed today. Remember, you can look at the lecture notes for a video that reviews what we discussed.</p>
    <p>-- the 'p' tag stands for paragraph, and is used to display text, like I am doing now. The h1-h6 tags are different defaults for headers of various sizes.</p>
    <p>--  The 'head' tag is the area that holds non-visual code. The 'body' tag is the visual part of the text. The 'html lang' tag designates what language (english) to be written in. The 'meta charset' designates the unicode characters used.</p>
    <p>-- The 'meta name' tag indicates the size of the window. The 'title' tag is the name.</p>
    <p>5. Paste the link to your web page. If you don't get it working, paste your questions. See the tutors tonight for help.</p>
