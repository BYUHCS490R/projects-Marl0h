        <h1>
            Web Design Web Site
        </h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        this is where links are located (most of the time)(nav tags i mean) the top of the page is the best place so the links are easily acessable for the main content between pages.
    </nav>
    <p>
        a structural tag changes the layout of the pages
    </p>
    <p>
        the header tag is the top section of the website, used for site identification and important menus
    </p>
    <main>
        <h1>
            put a heading tag in the main so the code doesnt complain & to announce what the main content is about
        </h1>
        <p>
            the main tag is where the main content goes. Every page should have a header, main, and footer + a nav if there are multiple links
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML verification is a w3 website that validates your website to see if there are any errors detected. future assignments will require that we validate our code and fix any errors (even if the site displays fine)
        </p>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>
            the footer goes at the bottom of the webbed site (hence the name footer) usually has less common used info or links</p>
        <p>
            the footer also includes copyright info (usually)
        </p>
