                Cascading Style Sheet. Cascading means that certain details have different priorities. In order, they go like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Html Attributes (tags like 'strong' or 'h3'): Limited ability and not used often
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inline CSS (examples below) used within the 'p' tag for example. Not to be used in this class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Embedded CSS: embedded in the head of the website, also not to be used in this class. Uses the 'style' tag
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        External CSS: Uses an external file to control the syle of the page. Connected to this page via a 'link' tag in the head of the website. example of use below.

            <dl>

                </h3>
            </dl>
            <dd>
                If we use the other forms of CSS, we will override any work that graphic designers put into making the website look good.
            </dd>
            <dl>
                <h3>
                    What is a selector used for?

            </dl>
            <dd>
                A selector is used to decide what tags are changed by the external css. we can select things by their tag name, location and tag, or more ways.
