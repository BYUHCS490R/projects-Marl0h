    <h1>Engagement - OL, UL</h1>
    <h3>1. Where can you find the lecture notes?</h3>
    <p>-- They are located in the modules for every week (currently we are in week 2)</p>
    <h3>2. When is your project due?</h3>
    <p>-- The next project is due Wednesday, but they can be turned in as late as 5am Thursday</p>
    <h3>3. What are special entity characters?</h3>
    <p>-- Special entity characters are shortcuts to be able to use reserved characters in text. For example, there might be issues when the user types a less than sign because html might interpret it weirdly. To avoid that, the user can use a special entity character to use a less than sign or anything else. &lt; is shown by "& lt ;" (with no spaces)</p>
    <h3>4. What are phrase tags?</h3>
    <p>-- Phrase tags are ways to highlight text in various ways, from italics to highlighting to quoteblocks.</p>
    <h3>5. What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h3>
    <p>-- The difference is the ol tag is ordered, by number letter or numeral. A ul list is unlisted, and only uses bullet points</p>
    <h3>6. What is a DL?</h3>
    <p>-- According to w3schools, a dl (description list), is "a list of terms, with a description of each term." The way to mark this is with a dl parent tag, a dt naming tag, and a dd description tag</p>

    <h3>Notes &plusmn;</h3>
    <p>We covered a lot of tags last week as can be seen in my previous page</p>
    <p>the span tag does nothing by default, but it can be changed by the coder to make it do something</p>
    <p>the UL tag stands for unordered list. it is a way to make a list</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the li tag adds a bullet point to the front of the list</li>
        no tags leaves out the dot
        <li>the first tag that you use within a list should always be li, followed by a p tag or whatever else. the ul tag is the parent tag, and the li is the child, so to speak</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>the ol list creates an ordered list, and still uses the li tag like the ul</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>by adding an attribute within the ol tag, we can change some things</li>
        <li>in this instance we put ol type="a", which creates lowercase abcdef...</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>by extention we can change it to upper case.</li>
        <li>type="i" makes lowercase roman numerals, and type="I"makes uppercase roman numerals</li>
    </ol>
    <p>below is an example of a description list</p>
    <dt>
        <dt>Pikachu</dt>
        <dd>a yellow rat pokemon</dd>
        <dt>Mew</dt>
        <dd>A pink legendary pokemon</dd>
    </dt>
