        <p>
            A link can be placed anywhere really, like a paragraph tag. Typing "a" will make the option appear in VSC. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25">This text is what becomes clickable</a> and this link leads to an outside source. This is an absolute link, which contains the whole <em>path</em>. (the https,www.,the domain name, and the .com/org/whatever)
        </p>
        <p>
            A link to another page on my own website looks like <a href="sept19.html">this</a> (code wise). This is called a relative link.
        </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</li>
            <li>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</li>
            <li>What is a default document?</li>
            <li>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</li>
            <li>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</li>
            <li>List the 3 rules with relative links.</li>
            <li>Link to your last project.</li>
            <li>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25">link here</a></li>
                <li>The root is the home page (base page, main page), it loads when there is nothing in the path</li>
                <li>A default document is the index.html filename that will load instead of the default file list that shows without one</li>
                <li>An absolute link links the whole path to usually an outside website. A relative link links the path itself, and it links to a website within the same domain, just with a new path.</li>
                <li><a href="sept19.html">Link to previous activity page</a></li>
                <li>we will cover this wednesday according to Professor</li>
                <li><a href="sept19.html">Same link to my previous assignment</a></li>
                <li>Links do not have to be in a nav tag, but you should use it at the top of the page to link to the important links under your website</li>
