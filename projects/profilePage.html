    <h1>The Most Basic HTML Page about Marloh</h1>
    <h6>I'm not using my real name so 'Marloh' is my alternative</h6>
    <hr>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Where does one start when introducing themselves on a webpage that will never be seen except for the people grading the assignment and wanderers finding the most obscure places on the internet? 
    </p>
    <h2>Interests of Mine</h2>
    <h3><em>Sports</em></h3>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching sports, and my home state of Colorado has most of the major sports options, so my allegiances are clear. I really only watch Basketball and American Football, (we dont talk about baseball). I am really excited for the Denver Nuggets and Denver Broncos this season, and I hope I can watch some good football and basketball this year. I also play basketball a little, as well as badminton. I'm not very good though.
    </p>
    <h3><em>Video Games</em></h3>
    <p>
        The fact I have a username beyond my real name should be an obvious giveaway that I play video games. Notable ones are <mark>The Division 2, Starbound, Rimworld, Risk of Rain 2, Minecraft, Terraria, and Pokemon&trade;.</mark> I mostly play singleplayer games, or games with friends, as I realized a few years ago that competetive games against other people tended to make me angry, and I decided that the anger I was feeling wasn't worth the small amounts of dopamine I felt. Playing these singleplayer games has made me chill out and I dont play competetive games like I used to unless I am playing with friends.

    <h4>Favotite Pokemon</h4>
    <p>Everyone has heard of Pokemon. Here is a short list of my favorites, whether you care or not. Unfortunately I do not yet know how to attach photos so you'll just have to Google them</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Meowstic</li>
        <li>Glaceon</li>
        <li>Lucario</li>
        <li>Leafeon</li>
        <li>Absol</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Music</em></h3>
    <p>
        I listen to a lot of music, and I think a lot of it is indie/indie rock, but I also listen to a lot of genres from hyperpop and breakcore to rap and hiphop to more theatrical stuff like Car Seat Headrest (yes thats the name of the band). Listing a bunch of bands I am listening to right now would become dated in a few months so I'll just list a few of the mainstays.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Happy Fits &lt;--(new album out on September 19th I'm excited)</li>
        <li>almost monday</li>
        <li>half&bull;alive</li>
        <li>Dayglow</li>
        <li>femtanyl</li>
        <li>Good Kid</li>
        <li>JID</li>
        <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
        <li>Tyler, the Creator</li>
        <li>d4vd</li>
        <li>kmoe</li>
        <li>Wallows</li>
        <li>The Wrecks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of the songs I listen to are very uplifting, and a lot of them are quoteable. I'll spare you the time by just listing this one quote that has stuck with me for a while now though.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Who you are is where you put the hours in</strong></blockquote>
    <h2>-- All My Love(Imperitive), by half&bull;alive</h2>
    <p>Anyone reading this should definately give these artists a listen, even though I know some of them are not going to be listenable for people. I swear they are good you just gotta open your mind.</p>
