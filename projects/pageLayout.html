            Pokemon is a franchise mainly focused on games based around the creature collecting and turn-based battling system. First released in 1996 for the Nintendo platform, it became an international hit. Pokemon as a franchise is a venture between three companies. The Pokemon Company, which handles merchandise and events and more. Game Freak, who develop the main-line games and some spin-off games. And Nintendo, who handle events and are the only company with consoles that the games are published to, with a few exceptions for mobile games. Releasing October 16th is a new Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends Z-A.

            Pokemon themselves are the creatures that star in the games. Every new mainline game introduces new creatures with new designs and statistics to create new and interesting interactions. People across the world have fallen in love with these creatures, and with over a thousand different Pokemon, everyone can find a creature they love. In the links above you can navigate to see and learn more about some of my personal favorite pokemon. On the image on this screen you can see some examples of pokemon, including Pokemon's mascot, Pikachu.
