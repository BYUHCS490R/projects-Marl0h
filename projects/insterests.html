            Music is the only thing keeping me sane

            There are some days where I am barely holding on, but my music is the only thing that has kept me from going postal. I have a varied music taste, but I like what I listen to and it keeps me tethered to reality. My music ranges from helping me go to sleep and doing hw to making me stare blankly at a wall til i realize how entranced I was in the music. I could be happy losing my eyesight as long as I kept my hearing, because music means so much to me.

            My favorite band is The Happy Fits, who just released an album a few days ago as of writing, named Lovesick. I have really enjoyed the album and I feel almost guilty listening to anything else because it is such a perfect album for me. The year 2025 has just been amazing for music so far, with a really good Clipse album, a good Tyler, the Creator album, a JID album, a really beautiful Car Seat Headrest album, and a few more albums on the way like and Ed Sheeran album and Taylor Swift album. Those last two I don't listen to much but I will definately give them a listen.

            To completely change topic, I need to explain links within html pages. There are two types of links, a relative and an absolute link. An absolute link is a link that takes the user to a new website, coming from a completely different server than the site that the user was on originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/yPn7BMFyIRM?si=u3-4tp6KHRVpz5RT">This</a> is an example of an absolute link, which takes the user to the youtube video of my favorite song off the new Lovesick album. A relative link, however, links to a website within the same server, usually only changing the path of the link and not switching domains. <a href="profilePage.html">Here</a> is an example of a relative link that links to my profile page.
