            Calvin Langman

        <p>
            Calvin Langman is the lead singer for The Happy Fits, and what makes him and his band so amazing to me is that he plays the cello. I unfortunately have never been in the right place at the right time to be able to see them live, but I have been listening to this band for a few years now. The band was formed in 2016, and they have been making indie/indie rock music since then. Clavin has stayed with the band, being the remaining half of the founding duo. Their newest album is special because there are two new members, both women, who really add extra depth to their music and every band member's vocals are amazing. I have wanted to play cello because of Calvin and his energy, using straps on his cello so he can move around while playing. <span class="italic crimson">Below is a list of some of my favorite songs by them (not in any particular order).</span>

                Sarah's Song - (off the Lovesick Album)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                This song might be on this list due to recency bias, but everything about this song feels great to my ears. The super catchy chorus about how the sweetest and prettiest of things source from the most "sorid" and unsavory places, and the potential barbs and thorns that come with those thoughts. The song emphasises that great things are made all the sweeter when we have the bad or dark times to compare them to.

                Mary - Live at the Troubadour - (song originally off the Concentrate album.)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                I am a sucker for live versions of songs, hearing the energy of the crowd and hearing the raw vocals of the artist as they perform for their fans. This rendition of Mary is an upgrade to the studio version, as the lyrics and less polished performance plays into the theme of the song, creating a very fun listening experience.

                Everything You Do - (off the Lovesick Album)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Released early as part of the rollout for the Lovesick album, this song has an infectious energy, with the loud, rambunctious feel that gets the listener going, pulling in the user to the story of the song's protagonist, who starts by proclaiming how <span id = "ital">"moody, moody, moody"</span> they are before they catch love at first sight, pulling them out of a funk to instead chase their new love, with an amazingly funky backing track that cant get the listener to stop loving everything about this song.
