                        I love playing games. It's like, my only hobby. I've played games for as long as I can remember, playing Risk on my parent's old PC years ago. Thinking about it, that is probably what has shaped my current taste in games, at least a little. I love modding games as well, I love the community of modders and how people come together to express what they enjoy by creating new content for it. I'm still fairly new to coding in general so I haven't gone too far down the modding rabbit hole but mods are so much fun. Below is a list of games I enjoy, not ranked in any particular order.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have a love hate relationship with Minecraft. I love playing with friends, and it really is an amazing game, but I also hate playing on my own and I can't do anything as I watch Mojang and Microsoft make it a bit worse with every update. Maybe thats harsh but its my website I get to be as exaggerative as I want.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="gameCard">

                        <img src="risk.jpg" alt="visually obnoxious screenshot of Risk of Rain 2">

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        This is in my top games of all time, I really can't express how amazing this game is. The gameplay loop is addictive and it only gets better with mods and friends.

                        A more recent addition to my games list, a lot of fun. It hits a sweet spot for me of upgrading, fighting npcs, and colony management.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="gameCard">

                        THE colony management game (with a UI made for normal people, dont get me started on Dwarf Fortress). I love colony management games, making upgrades and improving my colony's quality of life. I have so many hours in this game I really recommend it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another scifi game, this was my childhood game. I have so many hours playing this I really enjoy it. The exploration is so fun, even if there are some controversies around it. I love modding games and this one is so much fun.

                        Its Terraria, my favorite game to play with friends. Ive done lots of runs, modded and not. I dont do playthroughs on my own, I just prefer the gameplay with friends instead of on my own. Still an amazing game.

                        I dont have time to make an entire Pokemon page right now so Pokemon lives here. I love the creatures. The creatures are my favorite part of pokemon. I don't like how Pokemon has been making subpar games,and I do wish they would return to 2d sprites. My first game was Pokemon X. I think they could do a 2.5d type game (octopath Traveller). It would be sick.
