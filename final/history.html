                        Francisco Goya is probably one of my favorite artists of all time, at least classically. His paintings are so beautiful and so perfectly crafted. His most interesting paintings is a series named the Black Paintings. Painted onto the walls of Goya's house, these paintings are haunting, some being grotesque even. One painting that is circulated fairly often is the one named "Saturn Devouring His Son," which depicts a giant, grey haired man eating another, small man. The title comes from the Greek Myth that Saturn, one of the Titans of Greek/Roman mythology, devoured his sons so they could not overthrow him. It is gross to look at, and it becomes an even more interesting when you learn that Goya never gave names to these paintings. Goya, who once was a painter for the royal Spainish court in the late 1700's to early 1800's, gave the house to a relative. The paintings were discovered, but Goya never named the paintings, giving a dark meaning to some of them. It might be innocous and depict the greek myth, or it could be more insideous. The painting could have millions of meanings, and the same goes for the other Black Paintings. I almost wish they were never named, because I think there is merit in letting the viewer try and parse their own meanings to the paintings. Francisco Goya's earlier work is equally as beautiful, and sometimes haunting. I really like his works and he is my favorite artist.
