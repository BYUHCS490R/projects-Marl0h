        <p>
            I want to make a personal website where I can show off the things I have made, the things I am interested in, and the things I enjoy. I won'y use my real name, for the sake of some privacy.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Pages! Homepage & 5 pages of content [Page themes, content, at least one table, at least 2 sources]
        </h2>

                homepage (page 0)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Introdution to myself and the things I enjoy. A "guestbook" on the homepage for my form (it will process but not actually post a comment from a user, will return saying something like "Your comment will be evaluated and posted soon!"). Some art will be on the homepage. Will focus on the links to the other pages. Main body of the main page will be about my interests, and the bottom of the page will have update information.

            </dt>
            <dd>
                The table here will be at the top, made with a scroll bar so it doesnt take up the whole page. it will display my 5-10 highest ranked songs and albums. Below that will be cards that go with each album, with my thoughts attached.

                This page will host my thoughts on games and things I want to talk about when it comes to my favorite games. Similar to the music page where I list the games and my thoughts on them, maybe with some updates as the games are updated and I enjoy them or hate them.
