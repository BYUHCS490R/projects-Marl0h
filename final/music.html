                    I have been listening a lot to Lovesick by The Happy Fits (featured on this page) The strings and vocals keep dragging me back. Id bet they end the year as my #1 artist on Spotify wrapped.

                    Here's a list of some of the albums and songs I've been listening to. Should give a pretty good look into the type of music I enjoy, and this list will be ever evolving. Below is also a table of some of my favorite songs! I highly reccommend anything you see here.

                        <p>
                            This is a fun album. I am a big fan of kmoe's previous work, and this, being their first full album, is a banger. The hyperpop genre is one of my favorites, and this album is sooo good.

                        <p>
                            A very soft album, focusing on acoutstic guitar, it makes for a mostly calming listening experience. This album makes me feel a lot of emotions, and I think it sounds beautiful.

                            An amazing concept album that tackles a lot of subjects with certified bangers. I hate how much I love some of these songs. The production is amazing, and a top 5 hyperpop album.

                            This one surprised me, it came out really fast, like the first singles came out then the album was out. I love this album, its got so many PEAK features. Danny Brown has crazy vocals, the features all do crazy good work. Favorite song is 1L0v3myL1f3!. Book of Daniel is also a banger.

                            Good Kid, THE indie rock darlings. And for good reason. Love their music, cant wait to hear their new album in 4 months (from the day I write this!!!!!!). Cannot wait! This EP was really fun, all the songs go hard, and I hope they continue to move in this direction!

                        <p>
                            My favorite album this year, 2025. The new members vocals are amazing, and I love that this album just all works together. It's got songs for all kinds of moods, while also staying super fresh and cohesive. The Happy Fits really delivered with this one, and I have never been so excited for an album where I actually watch the clock like I did for this one.
