                        Ok this might be embarassing but I dont care. Here's my art, not in chronological order because I cant be bothered. I want to use this to document my progress. I really enjoy making art I suggest it to anyone reading this.

                        Ive been trying to get a little better with each work, and I think this shows that I'm making progress. (its compressed I know). I think I got a good composition following the copper rod he's got. Also the expression looks pretty good I think. I forgot some details I ususally add to his design but I think it looks good. I think I should work on backgrounds next

                    <p>
                        As one does, I have mostly drawn Arlo, and for this website I thought it'd be cool to draw him sitting on the front page of the website. I got it to work, but I know there's probably some way to make it look better. I really like this piece, definitely proof to myself that I'm improving somewhat! I'm having fun making art and that's what matters most to me!

                        This is an older piece, evident by the lack of shading, and the not great anatomy(?). idk Arlo himself looks not amazing I could have done better. Also making the brick wall took forever. I think some shading would make this look a lot better but cest la vie

                        Here's a rough character sheet for another character I created. I think I really learned how to do hair here. One step at a time. I like his design I've just not drawn him yet cause I dont have a full outfit in mind.

                        This was a quick fan art I made of a game called Easy Delivery Co. Its a cozy driving game where you drive between delivery points in a frigid, mountainous area. I think its fun, and I liked the character design enough to draw the main character dropping off some packages. I like the brush I used for coloring here.

                    <p>
                        I have older art than this but I gotta have a stopping point somewhere, so here is Arlo's first design. A lot of the elements are still the same, I like the design I made. I definitely got better at hair and lineart and shading and such but I think I did pretty good for how inexperienced I was and still am. I did this with no real reference as well, so honestly not bad for my first created character.
