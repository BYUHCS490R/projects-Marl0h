                            I started following my teams of the Denver Broncos and Denver Nuggets during the Nuggets' championship run, and then the Broncos ditched Russel Wilson for Bo Nix. So not really that long. BUT. When I find a new hobby I enjoy, I really throw myself into it, and now I have a lot of useless stats filling my head. This page is dedicated to the sports athletes I follow and I'm a fan of.

                            My GOAT. I dont really think I need to say anything about him, he's my favorite player, and I love to talk game with anyone who will listen. I love his attitude, a calm, silent guy who stays out of the limelight, in contrast to the NBA players who refuse to stay out of the media. It's refreshing.

                            I've been a Bo-liever since the Broncos drafted him, I had some heated conversations with some other fans about how Bo Nix would be a billion times improvement over Russel Wilson, and I was right. Come what may, I want to be known as a day one Bo-liever (cardiac arrest inducing wins and all).
